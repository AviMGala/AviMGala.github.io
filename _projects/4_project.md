Built a language model trained on David Goggins' content scraped from YouTube. We linked the language model output to a deepfake and prompted the model to thank our professor Swabha. Here is the result (our research paper is also embedded on this page):

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
